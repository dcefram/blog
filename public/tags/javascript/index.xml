      <description>Scenarios wherein you need to render a string with html tags in it would still require you to use dangerouslySetInnerHTML&amp;hellip; so if your problem is as such, then I guess there&amp;rsquo;s still no better way to parse strings with html tags.
As for scenarios wherein we would need to pass a content to a reusable component through attributes, then this would work. A simple example might help right?
The scenario In this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll be using ReactTooltip as our reusable component.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s first define an example problem to better understand the issue we have with normal looping:
For example, we have an array of post IDs that we would fetch and then print it out on the console
const ids = [1, 2, 3, 4]; for (var id of ids) { fetch(`${API_URL}/${id}`).then(() =&amp;gt; { console.log(id, response.results); }); }  The output of the above code would be different results with the same id, wherein the id printed would be the last number</description>

      <description>EQCSS allows us to style elements based on the element&amp;rsquo;s state. It is similar to CSS&amp;rsquo; media queries, but with the added feature to style elements based on the element&amp;rsquo;s dimension and contents, and not just based on the browser&amp;rsquo;s width and height.
This got me interested since my previous project&amp;rsquo;s longstanding issue was with how the app should look like based on a combination of two factors: The window&amp;rsquo;s size and the number of elements inside the container.</description>

      <description>Immutability is important. The stackoverflow article that I just linked would explain why immutability is important.
I am accustomed to using Immutable.js at work, but when I came across an ancient project that didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to add a new library just for using immutable objects, I had to resort to Object.assign.
But the problem with Object.assign though is that you cannot use it to modify deep properties.
Take this for example:</description>

      <title>Using datasets to avoid inline arrow functions</title>

      <description>Adding an inline anonymous/arrow function in React is not recommended due to the nature of how react behaves. The render method would always be called each time a state or property is updated, which would then create a new function if we are using inline arrow functions, and then this would force the GC (garbage collector) to clean the previous arrow function.
render() { // Not good :\  return &amp;lt;div onClick={e =&amp;gt; console.</description>
