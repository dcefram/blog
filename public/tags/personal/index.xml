      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Ghost for quite sometime already, and my only opensource project in github that was starred by non-collegues is a Ghost theme that I made for my blog. But times has changed, which some of you who are avid readers of my blog might have noticed, my financial situation requires me to be a little more stringent&amp;hellip; which also meant that I had to downgrade my VPS.
Ghost did well as a blogging platform, but the reasources it consumed, particularly RAM, was just too much.</description>

      <description>I decided to restart my blog yet again, and this time I&amp;rsquo;m planning to just document my thoughts at least every month. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to getting this goal done, specially with the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m getting married in 2~3 weeks time!&amp;hellip; Which means that I might actually have more things to write about :D
A lot has happened since last year. I clocked a lot of extra hours of work, for the preparation of my wedding.</description>
