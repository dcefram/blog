It's been over two years since I joined Inspectorio. I started as an individual
contributor, but I was thrust into a leadership role right after my first month.
It has been an interesting journey, and, much like my time with
[XSplit]({{< ref "/journal/on-to-a-new-challenge.md" >}} "On to a new challenge"),
I would attribute a great deal of my professional growth to this experience.

Over a month ago, I handed in my resignation letter, and today is my last day.
I'll soon be joining a local bank, so this is the perfect time to reflect on my
journey with Inspectorio. My time here has been marked by unique challenges
brought on by the macroeconomic situation, which greatly shaped my perspective
on various issues. I held a leadership position during a period when companies
were hiring engineers aggressively and experienced the fallout that followed.

## Growth outside technical skills

At my previous employer, Dealtale, I built some of the most valuable networks I
ever had, establishing a reliable reputation with senior leadership who have
close ties with well-funded VCs. In contrast, at Inspectorio, the most
remarkable value I gained was from managing a team and greatly improving my soft
skills. This experience made me yearn for a position where I could have a broader
impact, beyond what I could achieve as an individual contributor.

The first half of my stay at Inspectorio was during the hyper-growth period across
the industry right after the pandemic. One of the unique challenges during this
time was the fact that engineers could easily move to other remote opportunities,
so we had to ensure that the team is happy and challenged by the work we are doing.
However, working on an existing product that had been around for more than six years
presented hard constraints, making it difficult to introduce drastically new patterns
and technology. This made keeping highly skilled engineers engaged and interested
a tricky task. During this time, I identified the different types of engineers
on my team and what aspects made them feel happy and satisfied. I'll blog more about
this in the near future once I flesh out my thoughts on this interesting topic.

The second half of my stay was during the economic downturn that was felt by the
whole industry with mass layoffs happening throughout the whole tech industry.
Navigating through this time was particularly tricky because the change was sudden,
from a hyper-growth stage, and then turning 180 degrees, where mass layoffs became
the norm.

One thing I was particularly proud of was that my team was spared from major changes
through most of this troublesome period by consistently being one of the more performant
and stable team. We weren't completely spared though, as we had to let go off one
of our members at the start of this year, an event that eventually landed me on my
next opportunity. I wasn't fond of how it was handled in all honesty, as I knew that
the person we're letting go is a key contributor to our team, it's just that the
whole team were all high-performing engineers. I still feel that it was the wrong
move, having to let go an engineer per team, without giving me the opportunity to
persuade the decision makers as to why it's not the right decision to go for.

This was one of those moments that I am not particularly proud of. I could always
tell myself that I, as a line manager, did not exactly have all of the influence
that could've resulted on a better outcome so that I can sleep at night, but
it's still something that did leave a bad taste on my end. On the human side of
things, he was retrenched when he just got his first kid, and it was right before
the TET Holidays, during the time where the economy wasn't doing particularly well.

This challenging period did give me the opportunity to experience an environment
where the whole organization is on their feet, trying their best to stay afloat and
weather the storm. I was involved in meetings where the co-founder and CEO was present,
ready to grill everything that I had to say and all of the details of the reports I
was presenting. I had one [blog post about one of my lessons learned after a presentation]({{< ref "/journal/on-to-a-new-challenge.md" >}}),
and hopefully I get to write additional posts in relation to the things I
learned during this unique time. I am forever grateful for Carlos and the
whole company for this experience, as it's something that is hard to learn
without being in the unique situation that we were in.

## Why am I leaving

As I mentioned earlier, I wasn't super happy on how things were handled in
earlier this year, and that was the trigger that made me entertain the headhunters
that were reaching out in LinkedIn.

Although things turned out positively as the year went by, where I am honestly looking
forward on how things pan out with the changes made in the organization level, I
was offered to join a banking corporation in the PH as a Senior Assistant Vice President
and Principal Engineer. I felt that I would regret it if I turned down the offer, and thus
here I am, jumping to the unknown yet again.
