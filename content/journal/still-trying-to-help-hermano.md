I'm not sure how those suicide hotlines do it, but it's really hard to figure out the right words.

I opened up to him that there were many things in my life that I wished was different, but there is
not much we can do about the past.

Some quotable quotes I did end up sharing that I thought is worth posting:

> It is maybe healthy to acknowledge the fact that you cannot get back what is lost,
> whether it be time or opportunities, but we need to realize that each day is an opportunity to right the course.

> The past already impacted the present, but what you do now will impact what comes next.

But I did acknowledge that I have a below average EQ score, and I'm not in a position of authority in this subject,
thus I implored him to try out getting therapy. I'm even willing to pay for it if in case he does opt in.
