Our requirement was a real “Partner Mode,” where the piano splits into two sections with the same key range. The most affordable option from a reputable brand was the Korg B2.
The cheapest we could find from a reputable brand was Korg's B2.

Buying in their physical store is ₱2,000–₱3,000 cheaper than the price listed on their website. It’s a good price for a starter piano.
I was hesitant to buy my daughter a more expensive model since I wasn’t sure the hobby would stick.

After activating all the bundled Korg software, I started re-learning piano myself—I used to play as a kid in the UAE.
So maybe a pricier piano wouldn’t be a waste after all, since I’m using it on weekends too.

One of the software bundled with Korg was a 3 month license of [Skoove](https://www.skoove.com/en), which I found really useful for self learning piano for myself while my daughter attends "proper music classes".

If ever this _hobby_ does not fade away for either my daughter or myself, I might consider buying a better Korg piano.

### August 21, 2025 Update

I caught my daughter playing a piece that wasn't part of her music lessons. It's sort of a hint to me that she's really interested as she's going beyond the lesson plan.
