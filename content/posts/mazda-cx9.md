It's been over a month since we got our Mazda CX-9 Turbo Exclusive. It wasn’t my first choice, as I was gunning for a Ford SUV at first, but because of how the agent I was in contact with handled the transaction, we ended up going for a Mazda, and I'm glad that we did.

> Side note: I very much dislike Ford Cainta as they are _prioritizing_ customers that went for an in-house financing scheme. I waited for my unit for four months only to find out that someone got their unit in less than a month because they took out a loan with the dealer.

We first had a test drive with the Mazda CX-8 and were very much impressed with the interior and the ride quality. There were physical buttons everywhere which is very much preferred when driving.  

But we went for the bigger brother, the CX-9, as the top-of-the-line CX-8 only came in a captain’s chair setup, which isn’t the best setup when you have a kid and a toddler. The top-of-the-line CX-9 came with a bench 2nd row, which is perfect when you have two kids that is very clingy with their mom.

I received the unit after 3 weeks, which is pretty fast considering that buying a Mazda in the PH is done by order, and usually does not have a unit ready in the showroom.

It set us back around 2.99m, and an additional 189k for the [Zivent PPF I got from Olympus](https://www.facebook.com/olympuscarfilms/posts/pfbid0YsLSYGgCC9ZeNhfnS2dptFtv3qnTyLW6W6qRpsNrVFjEURwkFw5FnJLurqDhJhrXl).

I really like its handling while at high speeds as it’s really planted to the ground even though it’s a big crossover/SUV. It could go from 0-60kmph in 7 seconds which does give some thrill while driving just past midnight.

I’ve also worked in the car a couple of times when I had to drive my kids to school and I appreciate how comfortable it is during those situations.

I’m pretty much happy with the purchase, and I don’t see myself buying another car that isn’t as comfortable as a Mazda in the future.
