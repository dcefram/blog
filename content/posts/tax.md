As an employee, di mo yan matatakasan. But as an independent contractor, ala non-licensed professional, consultant, fuweelancer, yada yada,
madaling takasan ang tax. Wag ka lang mag bayad, wag magarbo ang buhay, wag mansyon ang bahay, wag magyabang, maging mabaet sa kapwa, at
ma e-evade mo yang tax na yan. Pag ginawa mo yun, ha, isa kang masamang tao.

Since I pride myself as the _most humblestest and kindest person in the whole world_, evading my tax obligations is a no go. Oo, medyo malaki
laki ung tax na babayaran ko considering mas kinder-er ang mga bossmen ko overseas, I need to do what is right, and paying my taxes is what is
right.

But the hassle of getting to the point of being able to pay my taxes is such a chore that it makes me feel like they made it hard because they
don't want me to pay. Halika, ikwento ko ang estorya ko.

### Transfering of RDO

My previous employer was at McKinley so I had to first transfer my BIR RDO from RDO 44 (Taguig) to RDO 46 (Cainta-Taytay). Why so? E kasi sa
Rizal ako nakatira e.

The first time I went to the BIR in BGC, the lines were long. It was just after things lightened up a little after the thing called ECQ during
the pandemic, and ang haba ng pila grabe.

I went through all that hassle, and when I called after 3 weeks or so, my RDO still wasn't updated! So I scheduled an appointment again, and
this time the lines weren't that long. It took me about 30mins to get through all of that again, but that 30mins was all for nothing since when
I called them up again after another 3 weeks, my records were still not updated.

Kaya ginawa ko nalang is I went directly to RDO 46, and told them that I already passed my papers (Form 1905) twice, one was almost 2 months
ago, and the last one was almost 4 weeks ago. Dapat ginawa ko nalang ito nung umpisa pa lang, kasi I called them after a week, and all my
records were updated kaagad.

With that done, the next step was to secure an OTR from my municipality.

### Getting an Occupational Tax Receipt (OTR)

This one was a quick one. So it's the Delta variant season around this time, and I decided to go get my Occupational Tax Receipt along with
paying my land taxes kasi it's on the same building naman. Alam mo na, make efficient use of time kuno.

Apart from it being the delta variant season, it was also election season where politicians go about spreading the virus to their supporters
hoping that they stay alive until they cast their ballots. This was a good thing kasi there was some bigshot presidential politician trying to
woo people in the municipal hall, kaya wala masyadong pila sa mga counters for the land tax and dun sa window for the cedula, which is the
same window for the OTR.

I did all my municipal hall related errands within 30mins tops, and a negative 10k in my wallet. Mahal nga pala ang amilyar. Pero ung OTR, it
was just around 300 pesos or so.

### Registering the "Business"

Heto na, Form 1901 na ang ipapasa ko. I'm going to establish my own business! Este, self-employed chuvaness lang.

The _Taxpayer Type_ that I had to tick in the form is "**Single Proprietorship Only (Resident Citizen)**".

As for the _Line of Business_ field, I wrote down "**Freelance - Computer Programming**" as this is what is available in BIR's newest
shenanigan of a system called IRIS.

Lastly, I made sure to put a tick on the 8% flat tax rate. If I don't do that, I'll be paying taxes using the graduated tax table which
would put me to the 32% tax bracket. 8 and 32 are two numbers that are very far apart.

The whole ordeal took me 6 hours, most of which was waiting on queue. The process was:

- go to the window for New Business Registration, **pass in your form 1901** along with your **OTR** and a photocopy of your ID.
  - _make sure that the address reflected on your ID is the same as your business address. If it isn't, get a photocopy of your latest proof of billing that has your name on it and the correct address, and print it alongside your ID._
- after that goes well, you'll proceed to the cashier to pay off 500 pesos for the business registration, and another 30 for the documentary stamp.
- go back to the New Business Registration window, and pass the form with the attached receipt.
- the teller would proceed to tell you to get an Accounting Book before they would release your CoR.
  - in my case, she also proceeded to inform me that either I get it outside of the BIR or buy it from her. If I buy it from her, I'll be sure that the required stamps, etc. are correct which would save me some time. So yeah, I bought the books from her and also the ORs. It costed me 1.2k.
- The CoR was released the same day, but it took around 3 hours of waiting before my name was called.

With my CoR on hand, I can now proceed to pay my taxes the correct way.
