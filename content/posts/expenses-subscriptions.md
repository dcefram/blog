I subscribed to [MoneyWiz](https://www.wiz.money) a couple of months ago and decided to check out
the pretty charts it can generate. The charts were indeed pretty, but the numbers were not.

The main culprit is business expenses, which I must check with my wife if her businessâ€™ profits
are enough to cover those operating expenses or not. It is just a few months in, so the operating
expenses are coming out from our family budget as was agreed upon when she initially floated the idea.

The next culprit is food, which unfortunately is something that I do not think we can workaround due
to the lack of time, which means we could not really cook much for ourselves. We have spent a
whopping 54k-55k in the span of 30 days on Grab food alone.

With my quest to tighten up our belt, I decided to find which of the bars in the bar chart I can
control, and one of which was our online subscription. Funnily enough, MoneyWiz is also a
subscription which I intend to continue paying because of the pretty charts. The top 3 culprits are:

- [Cleanshot](https://cleanshot.com/pricing)
- [Taxumo](taxumo.com)
- [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com)

The next would be this domain name, which I intend to keep for the near future.

With the top 3 subscriptions, Taxumo is the one that I would have a hard time cancelling as taxes are not fun.

So that left me with Cleanshot and Jetbrains.

I already started conditioning myself on just using VSCode, while occasionally using JetBrains for
the database manager (I have a perpetual license, so I hope I can squeeze the database plugin as long as possible).

As for Cleanshot, I do not plan to renew my subscription next year and would just use a free
alternative called [Kap](https://getkap.co/) for the screen recording and use [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/)
for the screenshots instead.

I host my blog in GCP, so it makes sense to also upload the screen recordings in Google Cloud
Storage, but unfortunately there is no existing plugin yet for that... which means I must build it
on my own.

With that, it seems like I would have my next set of content centered on the effort of
creating a GCP plugin for Kap, and making a fancy dashboard to list my screen recordings with some
sort of view count.
