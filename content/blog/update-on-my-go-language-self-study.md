So I've been busy lately that I wasn't able to update anything in my blog. I've just refreshed all the exercises in the Tour of Go except for the web crawler.

Here's the link: https://github.com/dcefram/go-learn/tree/master/tour

I also tried learning a little web development by following the web development tutorial in Go's official docs. Here's what I built: https://github.com/dcefram/gowiki

My next stop is to refresh my knowledge in [Gin](https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/), and start building a generic web platform for posting "tutorials". This is inspired from my previous freelancing project, wherein I wasn't able to accomplish this task due to the scope of the project.

I'll do this as my pet project from now on to practice my Go language skills. Good thing there's heroku for showing it off whenever I get to that point :)
