I decided to restart my blog yet again, and this time I'm planning to just document my thoughts at least every month. I'm looking forward to getting this _goal_ done, specially with the fact that I'm getting married in 2~3 weeks time!... Which means that I might actually have more things to write about :D

A lot has happened since last year. I clocked a lot of extra hours of work, for the preparation of my wedding. 2016 has been a hectic year, and I'm looking forward to whatever life throws to me moving forward.

Everyone has their own journey and this journal documents my journey.
