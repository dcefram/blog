I'm writing this blog post quite late, but I'll try to recall the outstanding events for this month.

### Regional Assembly Day(s)

We attended our first Regional Assembly together this month, and the topics were really good. The video drama however was what I would call "outstanding". It
's something that my fragile brain (ie. I have bad memory) could easily remember... even the line of one of the PoV (Point of View character) who said "Pag nabenta ko na ito, mabibili na namin ang apartment na gusto namin". The point of the video drama was to be careful in our decisions and always evaluate our priorities so that we may avoid following the footsteps of Lot's wife.

Pictures? Yeah, we have pics... specially since our friend Ate Shi looked for us, and dragged us along with her "rampa" or "gala" mode XD.

Unfortunately, this is all I have in my phone :(... I'm pretty sure that my wife's phone have more pics than mine though.

**EDIT:** Got the pics from my wife's phone! :D

Wish.

Aaaand there you have it :D

### Dinner out date

Even with our financial situation, we were able to squeeze in a nice dinner date in a not-so-fast-foody restaurant at WalterMart. The restaurant's name is Kuya J's.

One complaint that I have though is that they seemed to be understaffed, which meant that it took quite some time before they were able to attend to our table. Serving was slow too, but the succeeding servings (since we ordered more than one viand) were just right on time.

Food quality though is acceptable. The price isn't cheap by any means, but it didn't feel like we were ripped off like in Pancake House. However, I would still prefer Isaw Haus over Kuya J's.

### Notes

This month had more contents then the previous month, which is actually good :D. Oh yeah, we even cleaned up our dining table... but it's messy again as of the time I'm writing this haha
