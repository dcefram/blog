Most of the people at the company found out their raise yesterday, and I can tell you a lot of them got super demotivated. I myself on the other hand is not expecting much anyways, due to the fact that the project I'm working on is not yet pushed to the public. However, I was able to talk to the people that felt that they got the short end of the stick (and also through second hand information based on gossips), and I'll just document what my thoughts are about all this shenanigan.

# Bad vs. Good

On a lighter note, I found it funny that I was some sort of the bad guy when I tried to forward a job opening to a co-worker of mine since I was completely aware that she/he (what's a gender neutral word for this :|) was demotivated due to the raise.

Wait, wait, I know that it isn't wrong to share opportunities to other people… But when you put it on the context that Kel was thinking of how to comfort his teammates, you'll see that I was acting on the extreme side… Or maybe not. I don't know, but I think that if people aren't happy anymore with their job, I guess it's time to pack and leave and search for a greener pasture. Why waste your time on a job that you feel that you aren't getting what you deserve.

Let's get this straight, a job isn't something that you should get attached to. That might be a lot blurry if you have shares on the company, or if you're the founder/co-founder of the company. But if you're just an employee, even if you might be a pioneer employee, you shouldn't get attached too much to the point that you're investing your emotions into it… Because, the end of the day, there's a high chance that you are considered dispensable. That's the reality.

Be realistic. They would most likely fire you if they feel that they're getting the short end of the stick. Do the same if the situation is the other way around.

Most people tend to scare away from looking for other opportunities, but I just don't get it why. If you felt that you deserve more, then that should mean that you are confident enough on your skills that your work should be compensated higher than what it is now. So if you're confident on your skills, then what is stopping you on applying for another job?

# Contented

I on the other hand am content on whatever was thrown at me. I'm not sure why, but I guess this is part of being a dad (p.s. I always wondered why a dad on my former team was always happy even though it turned out that his raise wasn't large enough to be happy... Now I know why). This year, I got a single digit percent raise, but I don't feel demotivated at all… yet.

However, if I do find another opportunity that would be a lot more attractive overall than my current work, I might go for it. I'll just make sure to wrap things up first, since I do feel some sort of ownership with the project I'm currently working on.

Oh wait, don't mix up the feeling of ownership with the "emotional attachment" I was talking about earlier. One is a must as a professional, while the other is just simply being disillusioned.

I'll be posting this on my public blog too, because I can.
