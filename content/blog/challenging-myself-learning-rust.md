I've bought some books and courses for the Go programming language, and though I learned more in
[a tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/) than the books and courses I bought, I was able to learn
some few new concepts that wasn't related to Go.

I created tools using Go language as the language of choice nowadays, and I feel like the larger the
project, the harder it is to modify the code. It is true that there this is the case for most
projects, but I just feel like there is a lot of repetition going on.

Since my end goal was to choose and use a language for my own personal hobby project
(which is a web publishing platform for my own use), I thought of learning the direct competitor of
Go in that segment: [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). Since [Pheonix](http://phoenixframework.org/)
uses Elixir, and Pheonix is really popular as a web framework, I thought it made most sense to just
learn Elixir since I'm growing tired of using Golang for larger projects.

But after a short visit to Reddit, I decided to just learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) instead
after all the flamewars between Rust and Golang... (*Well, tbh, it is one sided... It's more of Rust
flaming Go users*)

So here's the challenge I shall take: Learn Rust.

This is not going to be easy since I've peeked into some Rust projects in Github and I didn't understand
much. It even has some ruby-like anonymous functions, and a bunch of other stuffs that were new to
my eyes like attributes (those `#[]` stuffs that I haven't yet really grasp the purpose of).

As a fallback, I might learn Elixir instead... so if you see me writing in Elixir in the very near
future (like a month or 2 from now), that would mean I failed on my personal challenge XD.
