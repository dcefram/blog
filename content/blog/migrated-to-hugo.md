I've been using Ghost for quite sometime already, and my only opensource project in github that was
starred by non-collegues is a Ghost theme that I made for my blog. But times has changed, which some
of you who are avid readers of my blog might have noticed, my financial situation requires me to be
a little more stringent... which also meant that I had to downgrade my VPS.

Ghost did well as a blogging platform, but the reasources it consumed, particularly RAM, was just
too much. I decided a few months back to create my own blogging platform with a decent markdown
editor just like ghost, but it didn't pan out well due to my day job.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I figured out that using a static site generator should be enough
for my blogging needs, so I settled down with Hugo. I also initially thought of porting
{{< url-link "Stupendous" "https://github.com/dcefram/Stupendous" "blank" >}} to Hugo, but then I
stumbled across Elixir which was far more interesting than making a port of my own theme. So I ended
up using a theme named
"{{< url-link "Future Imperfect" "https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect" "blank" >}}"
and had this impostor syndrome creeping back up due to the fact that this theme is way better
than my own design :(.

Anyways, I'll resume blogging about my personal life, parts that I feel and think is safe to share
to the internet. Aside from that, I might throw some rants or two, or maybe something new that I
learned along the way.
