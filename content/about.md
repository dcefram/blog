**rmrz**, as in RaMiReZ.

We bought this domain name to host our family's portal of sorts. We wanted to make our house a
tad bit smarter DIY style and have access to our smart appliances over the internet. Yeah, it's
a bad idea, it's like inviting bad actors to a flimsy door that they can break in and ruin your
house.

So now, this site is a simple blog, and hosts some personal tools we made.

This site is ran by two software engineers, who happen to be married. [Here's how we met](/journal/how-we-met/).

Right now, I (the husband) am currently the only active maintainer of this site as wifey
has other endeavors to tend to, and blogging isn't her passion.

My abbreviated name is **DC** (Daniel Cefram) while my wife's nickname is **AC**. Together we
are a:

We give a jolt to each other's lives. Booyeah, cheezit.

## About Me

I have over 15 years of experience in software engineering and leading teams, initially starting in the embedded engineering field with [Denso Ten](https://www.denso-ten.com/), then moving on to multimedia streaming software development with [XSplit](https://xsplit.com/), joined a couple of startups like [Dealtale](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dealtale/) by [Vianai](https://vian.ai/), led a product engineering team for a supply chain management SaaS platform known as [Inspectorio](https://www.inspectorio.com/),
and now a Senior Assistant Vice President and Principal Engineer at [Security Bank](https://securitybank.com.ph).

Outside of work, I draw doodles, write long walls of text, and experiment on things that is outside my area of expertise.

## Others

I'm trying to keep track on the skill-up endeavour I do, since you know, life is a continuous process of learning, where
the moment you stop learning, that's the moment life becomes dull and boring. I swear I did not come up with those words
and I just pulled them from the fragments of my scattered memory.

In any case, here's where I show it off: [the collection]({{< ref "/skill-up-collections.md" >}} "Skill Up Collections").

Another showoff: the [equipment and tools I use]({{< ref "/uses.md" >}} "Uses").

Also, this was the closest I could ever get to get inside the TV back when [I used to work with XSplit]({{< ref "/journal/on-to-a-new-challenge.md" >}} "On to a new challenge"). Hey Mom, look, I'm in... TwitchTV.

I'm not sure if I'm any better at public speaking ever since this one.
