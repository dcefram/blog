**rmrz**, as in RaMiReZ.

We bought this domain name to host our family's portal of sorts. We wanted to make our house a
tad bit smarter DIY style and have access to our smart appliances over the internet. Yeah, it's
a bad idea, it's like inviting bad actors to a flimsy door that they can break in and ruin your
house.

So now, this site is a simple blog, and hosts some personal tools we made.

This site is ran by two software engineers, who happen to be married.

The husband's abbreviated name is **DC** (Daniel Cefram) while the wife's nickname is **AC**. Together we
are a:

We give a jolt to each other's lives. Booyeah, cheezit.

## Comms

DC's a little more _internet active_ between the two, so comms goes through him:

- [@dcefram](https://twitter.com/dcefram) - DM me if you have comments for a blog post of mine
