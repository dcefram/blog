**rmrz**, as in RaMiReZ.

We bought this domain name to host our family's portal of sorts. We wanted to make our house a
tad bit smarter DIY style and have access to our smart appliances over the internet. Yeah, it's
a bad idea, it's like inviting bad actors to a flimsy door that they can break in and ruin your
house.

So now, this site is a simple blog, and hosts some personal tools we made.

This site is ran by two software engineers, who happen to be married. [Here's how we met](/posts/how-we-met/).

The husband's abbreviated name is **DC** (Daniel Cefram) while the wife's nickname is **AC**. Together we
are a:

We give a jolt to each other's lives. Booyeah, cheezit.

I'm trying to keep track on the skill-up endeavour I do, since you know, life is a continuous process of learning, where
the moment you stop learning, that's the moment life becomes dull and boring. I swear I did not come up with those words
and I just pulled them from the fragments of my scattered memory.

In any case, here's where I show it off: [the collection](/skill-up-collections).

Another showoff: the [equipment and tools I use](/uses).
