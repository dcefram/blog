Outside of work, I use Vue and Stylus for the frontend, and Hapi.js for the backend. However, I am currently learning [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) for the backend.

I am currently trying to wrap my head around Go just to add a compiled programming language to my skill set, and because Node.js just eats up my virtual server's RAM. I will blog about my progress in that part from time to time.

I tried to learn Rust too, but I can't help but feel like it takes more time to create a web server/backend and besides, [it's not yet recommended to use it unless I am creating an API, using external services, and writing SQL myself](http://www.arewewebyet.org/). I'll still use Rust for systems development, but for backend development, I'll have to stick with Go.

## Work

I am currently employed as a software developer at [SplitmediaLabs](https://www.splitmedialabs.com/). I'm involved in developing an [awesome video production software](https://xsplit.com) and a [social networking platform for gamers](https://player.me).

Outside of work, I do pickup some sides here and there, but I'm currently self studying Go language. So yeah, there goes my spare time.

## Others

I just got married to a super smart computer engineer who is way smarter at math than me. I met her at our previous job at Fujitsu, where she was a Systems Engineer for embedded systems (ie. Audio Video Navigation systems for cars), while I was a QA. She's currently employed as a project lead in a company that develops banking software.

I love surrounding myself with smart people, which explains why I fell for her, and always consider myself as a developer with lots of room for improvement. Can't let myself to stagnate... skill-wise.

Aaaaand for some quotes:
