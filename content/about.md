**rmrz**, as in RaMiReZ.

We bought this domain name to host our family's portal of sorts. We wanted to make our house a
tad bit smarter DIY style and have access to our smart appliances over the internet. Yeah, it's
a bad idea, it's like inviting bad actors to a flimsy door that they can break in and ruin your
house.

So now, this site is a simple blog, and hosts some personal tools we made.

This site is ran by two software engineers, who happen to be married. [Here's how we met](/posts/how-we-met/).

Right now, I (the husband) am currently the only active maintainer of this site as wifey
has other endeavors to tend to, and blogging isn't her passion.

My abbreviated name is **DC** (Daniel Cefram) while my wife's nickname is **AC**. Together we
are a:

We give a jolt to each other's lives. Booyeah, cheezit.

I'm trying to keep track on the skill-up endeavour I do, since you know, life is a continuous process of learning, where
the moment you stop learning, that's the moment life becomes dull and boring. I swear I did not come up with those words
and I just pulled them from the fragments of my scattered memory.

In any case, here's where I show it off: [the collection]({{< ref "/skill-up-collections.md" >}} "Skill Up Collections").

Another showoff: the [equipment and tools I use]({{< ref "/uses.md" >}} "Uses").

Also, this was the closest I could ever get to get inside the TV back when [I used to work with XSplit]({{< ref "/posts/on-to-a-new-challenge.md" >}} "On to a new challenge"). Hey Mom, look, I'm in... TwitchTV.

I'm not sure if I'm any better at public speaking ever since this one.
