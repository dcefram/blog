Here's a list of equipments and tools that I use for work and personal work-like hobbies.

## Devices

- 13" MacBook Air M1 (Work, company provided).
- 14" MacBook Pro M1 Max (Personal, experiments, personal projects).
- Lenovo Q24H-10 23.8" Monitor.
- Magic Keyboard.
- Magic Mouse.
- Sony WH-1000XM5.

## Editor

- Too dumb to use neovim productively, so VSCode.
- Also, Sublime and GoLand when I'm bored
- Sometimes neovim when my mood chooses it as the time sink of choice.

## Terminal

- I use [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/).
- I use [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) as my command line shell.

## Other Dev-ish Tools

- Sometimes I use `git` in the CLI
- Sometimes I use [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) when I'm bored. ([I have a license, weird flex](https://storage.googleapis.com/rmrz-blog.appspot.com/Snippet%202023-04-07%20at%2010.06.58.png).)
- I also have a [license](https://storage.googleapis.com/rmrz-blog.appspot.com/Snippet%202023-04-07%20at%2010.12.55.png) for [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) since I bought it as a bundle with Sublime Text 4. I use it when my mood dictates me to use it.
- [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) for relational databases. I thought I needed 2 licenses, could've lived with just one.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) at work, [Penpot](https://penpot.app/) for personal endeavors.
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for quick diagrams and even wireframes.
- I still use [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) Wireframes Desktop app. For some reason, it's still faster to wireframe using Balsamiq.

## Productivity Apps

- [LogSeq](https://bear.app/) for my notes at work.
  - I'm not decided what to use for my personal notes ever since ditching [Bear](https://bear.app/).
- I still use Apple [Notes](https://www.icloud.com/notes) when using my iPad because it got better Apple Pencil support.
- We use [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) at work... because [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).
- [Slack](https://slack.com) for work.
- Forcing [Discord](https://discord.com) for non-gaming use.
- [1Password](https://1password.com/) for now, but will ditch this soon once my subscription ends.
  - The older I get, the more Asian I become, i.e. the more cheapskate I become.
  - Bitwarden is great, but their desktop app isn't.
- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com).
- [Shottr](https://shottr.cc) when I need the pixels.
- [Presentify](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/presentify-screen-annotation/id1507246666) for screen annotations while presenting.
- [Maccy](https://maccy.app/) as my clipboard manager.
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com). Still better than Microsoft Editor.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) at work, just because.
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/ph/safari/) for personal use.
  - Not because it's great, but because I'm trying out Apple Keychain as an alternative that would eventually help me ditch 1Password

## Other Apps for weird flex

- I am unfortunately sucked into Steve's walled garden, so I use [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/).
- [Apple Podcasts](https://www.apple.com/apple-podcasts).
- [Reeder 5](https://www.reederapp.com/) to stay up to date with my favorite bloggers.
- Kindle for my ebooks
- [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/) as my backup storage.
  - Side note: Microsoft 365 Family is the cheapest "known" cloud service out there, even if you don't get to take full advantage of its office desktop apps.
  - My wife went back to Android, so we'll use M$ for anything collaborative (Word, Excel, etc.).
- [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com) for my photos, notes, and files.
