Here's a list of equipments and tools that I use for work and personal work-like hobbies.

## Devices

- 14" MacBook Pro M1 Max.
- Lenovo Q24H-10 23.8" Monitor.
- Keychron K3 Mechanical Keyboard.
- Magic Mouse.
- AirPods Pro.

## Editor

- **Current Primary:** [Sublime Text 4](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (Yes, I bought the [licenses for both Sublime Text](https://storage.googleapis.com/rmrz-blog.appspot.com/Snippet%202023-04-07%20at%2010.11.00.png) 3 and 4, weird flex, I know XD).
- **Secondary:** [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/).
  - [This is a must-have plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8575-nyan-progress-bar) when using GoLand (or any Jetbrains IDE).
- [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) is my font of choice.

## Terminal

- I use [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/).
- I use [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) as my command line shell.

## Other Dev-ish Tools

- I use [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) as my go-to Git GUI client. ([I have a license, another weird flex](https://storage.googleapis.com/rmrz-blog.appspot.com/Snippet%202023-04-07%20at%2010.06.58.png).)
  - I also have a [license](https://storage.googleapis.com/rmrz-blog.appspot.com/Snippet%202023-04-07%20at%2010.12.55.png) for [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) since I bought it as a bundle with Sublime Text 4.
  - Sublime Merge has better keyboard shortcuts, but you have no control on how the git log graph is grouped unlike in Fork. The whole purpose of using a Git GUI Client is for the graph though, so it's a deal breaker.
  - Resource usage wise, both are comparable, hovering around 100-300MB depending on how many repos are opened at a time.
    - Sublime Merge - Written in C++.
    - Fork - Objective-C + Swift.
- I use [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) for... MongoDB.
- While [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) for relational databases. Bought the standard license for 2 devices, should've just got the basic one for 1 device :|
- I still use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) at work, [Penpot](https://penpot.app/) for personal endeavors.
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for quick diagrams and even wireframes.
  - I used to use [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) a lot, but they're discontinuing their native apps. Might as well stick with the free alternative then.

## Productivity Apps

- [Bear](https://bear.app/) for almost everything note-related.
  - I dabbled with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but I have the "Electron" fatigue, where my brain prefers to go native than a webapp pretending to be native.
  - ~~On that note, I'm eager to see [Bear 2](https://beta.bear.app/) get released which would have the feature that I loved the most in Obsidian: backlinks.~~ Bear 2 is already out, and it has backlinks! :D 2nd brain all the way.
- I still use Apple [Notes](https://www.icloud.com/notes) when using my iPad because it got better Apple Pencil support.
- We use [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence) at work... because [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira).
- [Slack](https://slack.com) for work.
- Forcing [Discord](https://discord.com) for non-gaming use.
- [1Password](https://1password.com/).
- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com).
- [Shottr](https://shottr.cc) when I need the pixels.
- [Presentify](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/presentify-screen-annotation/id1507246666) for screen annotations while presenting.
- [Maccy](https://maccy.app/) as my clipboard manager.
- [iStats Menu](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus). One of my most useful impulsive buy ever which lead me see just how much RAM are eaten up by those Chrome-based apps.
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com). Still better than Microsoft Editor.
- [Arc](https://arc.net/) as my primary browser.
- Just recently started using [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) for easy access to Bing Chat. My co-working pal that never leaves me in seen-zone.

## Other Apps for weird flex

- I am unfortunately sucked into Steve's walled garden, so I use [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/).
- [Apple Podcasts](https://www.apple.com/apple-podcasts).
- [Reeder 5](https://www.reederapp.com/) to stay up to date with my favorite bloggers.
- Kindle for my ebooks
- [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/) for personal use. It also has a personal vault which I really appreciate.
  - Side note: Microsoft 365 Family is the cheapest "known" cloud service out there, even if you don't get to take full advantage of its office desktop apps.
- Unfortunately, [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com) for my photos and notes.
- I use Microsoft's office apps instead of Apple's built-in ones.
  - MS Excel is still years ahead of Numbers in my opinion.
  - MS Word is still a much more pleasant writing experience than Pages when I do need to use it instead of Bear for whatever reasons I can't think of while writing this down.
