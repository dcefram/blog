In my quest to continuously learn, here's a nice list to flex what I was able to finish, not necessarily
to the point that I can call myself as an expert to whatever subject matter the book or course covered :P.

## Career-related books

Hopefully all books I read is in goodreads too, so that I can simply rely on the widget below to show what I'm currently reading.

## Udemy splurges

I’m a little skeptical that the majority of the videos in Udemy are of acceptable quality, but I can swear by a couple of instructors
that has honed the art of teaching through a screen. Some of my favorite instructors are Dr. Angela Yu and Stephen Grider.

I’ll only list down the _courses_ that I did finish from start to end, to spare me the embarrassment of splurging a lot and never finishing any.
It’s the kind of _illness_ similar to those sucked in by the infamous Steam Sale.

- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) - [Udemy Course Completion Certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-30b98501-41cf-41ac-bf12-537603460515/)
